Welcome to A Sinful Nightmare

The year is 2004. Neon glow sticks litter the floor, and the faint smell of cheap perfume still hangs in the air. Prom night was everything you dreamed ofâ€¦or was it? Walking home under the pale moonlight, hand-in-hand with your date, the night takes a sinister turn. A distorted voice whispers from the shadows, and the chilling glint of a knife catches the streetlights. Ghostface is back, and he's crashing the after-party. Navigate a terrifying journey through suburban streets and forgotten paths, where every text message could be a clue or a death sentence. Unravel the twisted mystery behind the mask, protect your friends and your budding romance, and try to survive until dawn. But be warned: in this sinful nightmare, your deepest desires and darkest secrets might just be the very things that lead you to your doom. Perfect for players who crave a blend of nostalgic Y2K slasher horror, nail-biting suspense, high-stakes drama, and a touch of perilous prom-night romance.
