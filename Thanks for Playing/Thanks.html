          Thank you for playing the demo of A Sinful Nightmare. You've taken
          your first terrifying steps into a world where prom night dreams

          just the beginning of a chilling story, and more will be revealed.
          Stay tuned for the full game, where the line between dreams and
          reality blurs and the terror truly begins.
