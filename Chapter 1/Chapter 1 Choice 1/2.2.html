          "Did you... have a weird dream last night?" you ask, the words feeling
          clumsy and fragile in the bright morning air. Chloe looks at you, a
          flicker of confusion crossing her face. "A dream? No, not really. I
          was exhausted. Why?" You hesitate, the vivid details of the
          nightmare—the whispered threat, the glinting knife, the feeling of his
          presence—clinging to your mind like a spiderweb. "It's dumb," you
          finally say, a little embarrassed. "I just had this super realistic
          nightmare that someone was chasing us after the prom, like, a
          Ghostface killer. It was... intense." A nervous laugh ripples through
          the group. "Dude, that's messed up," Kevin says, shaking his head. "A
          little on the nose, don't you think?" Sarah adds with a wry smile.
          "Are you sure you didn't watch too many scary movies before bed?"
          "That's so creepy," Maya says, a shiver running down her spine. "I had
          a dream like that once, but it was just my ex-boyfriend in a Ghostface
          costume. Way less scary." You all laugh, the tension momentarily
          broken. But as the laughter fades, you notice Chloe's expression.
          She's not smiling. She's staring at you with a strange intensity, a
          look you can't quite decipher. "You're okay, right?" she asks, her
          voice low and serious. "Yeah," you say, a little too quickly. "I'm
          fine. It was just a dream." Chloe gives you a small, tight smile.
          "Just a dream." The bell rings, and the group scatters, heading for
          their classes. You and Chloe walk together in silence, the lingering
          weirdness of the conversation hanging in the air. The feeling of
          normalcy you had earlier is gone, replaced by a subtle, unsettling
          sense of dread. What will you do?
