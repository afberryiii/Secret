          You plaster on a genuine smile, pushing the lingering dread of the
          nightmare to the back of your mind. "Yeah, it was a great night," you
          say, your voice steadier now. "I'm just glad it's the weekend. I can't
          wait to just chill and not think about college applications for five
          minutes." A collective sigh of relief goes through the group, and the
          conversation shifts seamlessly to the mundane details of their summer
          plans. Kevin talks about his baseball team's upcoming tournament,
          Sarah complains about her part-time job at the local diner, and David
          excitedly details his plans for a new computer build. You find
          yourself laughing along with them, the familiar rhythm of your
          friendships a comforting blanket against the cold unease that had been
          nipping at your heels. You glance at Chloe. She's talking with Maya
          about a new art exhibit, her face animated and carefree. Seeing her so
          happy, so safe, you can't help but feel a wave of relief. It was just
          a dream. A bad one, sure, but nothing more. The bell rings, and the
          group disperses. You and Chloe walk to your first class together, the
          conversation light and easy. The morning sun streams through the
          school's windows, making the air feel warm and bright. You're safe.
          You're home. The nightmare is over. But as you reach your classroom, a
          single text message notification vibrates on your phone. You pull it
          out, a knot of dread tightening in your stomach. The message is from
          an unsaved number, and it reads: "Nice try. See you in class." Your
          blood runs cold. The phone slips from your grasp, clattering to the
          floor. The voice from your nightmare was a chillingly familiar echo,
          but the message is an even colder, more terrifying reality. This isn't
          a dream. This is real.
