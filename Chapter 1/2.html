          You jolt awake with a gasp, your body drenched in a cold sweat. The
          digital numbers on your alarm clock glow menacingly: 6:00 AM. The
          sound of the alarm is a jarring intrusion, pulling you from the
          terrifying dream. The events of the night before—the prom, the
          whispered threats, Ghostface, the chase—all of it dissolves into the
          hazy unreality of a nightmare. A text message notification on your
          phone reminds you that it's Monday morning, the first day of the rest
          of your life. The message is from Chloe: "Hey, are you up? The prom
          was so much fun! See you at school." You look at your phone, the
          screen a stark contrast to the fear that still clings to your mind.
          The dream was so real. Too real. You shake your head, trying to clear
          the lingering terror, as the scent of bacon from downstairs reminds
          you that reality—and school—awaits.
