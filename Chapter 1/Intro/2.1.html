        Reluctantly, you drag yourself out of bed, the cold sweat on your skin a
        tangible memory of the nightmare. The phone screen still shows Chloe's
        text, her cheerful words a stark contrast to the terror that still
        clings to your mind. You go through the motions of getting ready for
        school, the mundane routine of getting dressed and grabbing a quick
        breakfast a welcome anchor to reality. The walk to school is unnervingly
        normal. The same suburban street from your dream is bathed in the
        morning sunlight, the houses a comforting, mundane row of brick and
        siding. As you turn the corner to the school's front entrance, you spot
        Chloe at her locker, her hair pulled back in a practical ponytail. The
        relief that washes over you is a physical wave. She looks up, sees you,
        and smiles. For now, the nightmare is nothing more than a memory fading
        in the harsh light of a new day. As you approach, a boisterous group of
        seven friends—the main crew—surrounds her. There's Kevin, the
        charismatic jock with an easy laugh; Sarah, the witty one who always has
        a comeback; David, the quiet tech wizard; Maya, the artistic dreamer;
        and the inseparable trio of Alex, Ben, and Chris, who are always at the
        center of the group's antics. "Hey, sleepyhead!" Chloe says, her smile
        contagious. "Did you have fun last night? You guys left early." "Yeah,
        we were pretty tired," you say, your voice still a little shaky from the
        dream. "Best night ever, though." A wave of normalcy washes over you,
        but a small, persistent voice in the back of your mind whispers a
        warning. The nightmare felt too real to simply be a dream.
