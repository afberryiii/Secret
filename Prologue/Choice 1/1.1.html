          A surge of protective adrenaline floods your system. You yank Chloe's
          hand, shoving her behind you as you pivot and bolt. The sound of your
          running footsteps echoes off the silent suburban houses, a frantic
          drumbeat against the night. Chloe stumbles for a moment but quickly
          finds her footing, running with you, her panicked breaths heavy in the
          air. The chilling, raspy voice from the shadows calls out, "You can
          run, but you can't hide," followed by the sickening whisper of a knife
          slicing through the air. You glance back and see the shadowy figure of
          Ghostface emerging from between the houses, a dark phantom on your
          heels. You reach an intersection, and your heart sinks. To your left,
          a narrow alleyway disappears into darkness, and to your right, a
          small, overgrown path leads to what you remember is a shortcut through
          a neighbor's yard, dense with bushes and trees.
