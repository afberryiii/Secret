          "HELP!" The word rips from your throat, a desperate, raw plea that
          shatters the peaceful silence of the street. Your voice cracks, but
          the sound is loud and piercing. You glance at the dark, silent houses,
          a desperate hope fluttering in your chest. Surely, someone is awake.
          Someone heard you. Chloe, startled by your outburst, turns to you with
          wide, terrified eyes. "What are you doing?" she whispers, her voice
          trembling. The shadowy figure with the knife stops, a low, guttural
          growl rumbling from its chest. The brief pause is all you need. You
          yank Chloe's hand, pulling her back with you. The blade glints
          menacingly as it moves, but your cry has bought you a precious few
          seconds. You scan the area frantically for a place to hide. A large,
          gnarled oak tree stands to your left, its thick trunk and low-hanging
          branches offering a potential hiding spot. To your right, a neighbor's
          unlocked car sits in the driveway, its dark windows a tempting escape.
