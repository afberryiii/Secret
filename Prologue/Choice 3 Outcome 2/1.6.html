        You yank Chloe toward the car, fumbling with the handle. It's unlocked!
        You both pile into the back seat, slamming the door shut. Your breath
        comes in ragged gasps, and for a moment, you feel a surge of relief.
        You're safe. But the feeling is short-lived. The car's power locks click
        shut, and the windows fog up from your frantic breathing, trapping you
        inside. You try the door handle againâ€”it's locked. A terrifying, slow
        tapping on the driver's side window makes you both scream. Ghostface is
        there, his mask a blank, terrifying void as he stares at you through the
        misty glass. He holds the serrated blade up to the window, the tip of it
        slowly scraping down the glass with a long, chilling screech that makes
        your teeth ache. He slowly circles the car, the sound of his footsteps a
        heavy, rhythmic beat. He stops at the passenger side, slowly reaching
        for the handle.
