      You veer left without hesitation, pulling Chloe with you into the narrow
      alleyway. The darkness is absolute, a suffocating blanket that swallows
      the already faint moonlight. Your feet pound on the pavement, the sound
      now muffled by the tight walls of the alley, but the scent of damp garbage
      and stale air fills your lungs. You can hear Chloe's ragged breathing
      behind you, and you risk a glance back. Nothing. The alleyway is an inky
      tunnel, seemingly endless. You feel a flicker of hopeâ€”maybe you've lost
      him. But the text message notification in your pocket still vibrates, a
      constant, buzzing reminder that you're in danger. Suddenly, the alleyway
      opens up to a chain-link fence, a dead end. You spin around, a cry of
      frustration escaping your lips, only to see the silhouette of Ghostface at
      the alley's entrance, blocking your escape. The text message vibrates once
      more, its finality a cold, digital whisper. You watch as he raises the
      serrated blade, the streetlamp behind him casting a long, skeletal shadow
      that engulfs you. The last thing you feel is a sharp, searing pain in your
      side before the world goes black.
