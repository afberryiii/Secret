        The jarring buzz of your phone in your pocket feels like a lightning
        bolt, a stark, digital interruption to the primal fear seizing your
        body. You release Chloe's hand, your fingers fumbling for the device as
        your eyes remain fixed on the glinting blade. Your thumb swipes the
        screen to reveal the notification. It's an unsaved number, the message
        reading simply: "I see you." The words are a punch to the gut, a
        chilling confirmation that this isn't a random attack; it's personal.
        The phone's screen illuminates your face, a glowing beacon of your
        location in the dark. A low, mocking chuckle echoes from the shadows,
        and Ghostface steps into the dim light, the knife raised and ready. The
        last thing you see before the world goes dark is his featureless white
        mask, a blank canvas of pure, unadulterated evil.
