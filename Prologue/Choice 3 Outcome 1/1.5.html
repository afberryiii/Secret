        You yank Chloe's hand, shoving her towards the ancient oak tree. "Get
        behind it, now!" you hiss, your voice barely a whisper. You follow her,
        pressing your back against the rough bark, the scent of damp earth and
        leaves filling your nose. The tree's thick trunk conceals you, but the
        low-hanging branches offer only a flimsy shield. You hold your breath,
        your heart pounding a frantic rhythm against your ribs. You hear the
        soft shuffle of footsteps, a sound that seems impossibly loud in the
        dead silence. A shadow falls over the other side of the tree, and you
        can see the faint outline of a boot. You and Chloe press closer, your
        bodies a single, shivering unit. The blade scrapes against the trunk, a
        chilling, metallic shriek that makes Chloe stifle a small gasp. The
        scraping stops, and a guttural laugh echoes, a sound that seems to come
        from all around you. You hear the rustle of leaves and a low, menacing
        whisper. "I know you're there. And I'm going to find you." The whisper
        seems to be right next to your ear, and you turn your head, only to see
        Ghostface, his mask inches from your face. His blade glistens in the
        moonlight, a cold promise of finality.
