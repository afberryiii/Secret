      You instinctively veer right, pulling Chloe along the overgrown path. The thorny bushes and low-hanging branches scratch at your clothes and skin, but the dense foliage offers a momentary sense of concealment. The sounds of the street fade behind you, replaced by the frantic rustle of your own movements and the heavy thud of your heart against your ribs. Just as you think you've found a way to safety, the ground gives way beneath your feet. You stumble and fall, pulling Chloe down with you into a hidden ditch. The impact sends a sharp pain through your ankle, and you cry out, the sound swallowed by the thick vegetation.

A dark figure looms above you, the iconic Ghostface mask a white smear against the star-studded sky. The blade glints in his hand, a cold promise of finality. He laughs, a low, guttural sound that sends shivers down your spine. He raises the knife, and you close your eyes, bracing for the end.
