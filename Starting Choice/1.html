                The last bass-heavy beat of "Yeah!" by Usher still vibrated in your bones, a fading echo of prom night euphoria. You kicked at a discarded neon green glow stick, sending it skittering across the cracked pavement. Its dim light briefly illuminated the sticky remnants of spilled punch and glitter that still clung to your dress shoes. A faint, cloying scent of cheap perfume and teenage dreams hung in the cool night air. Prom had beenâ€¦ well, it had been exactly what you'd dreamed of, hadn't it? The awkward slow dance with your date, the slightly-too-loud conversations, the nervous laughter.

You glanced at Chloe beside you, her hand nestled warmly in yours. Her hair, still perfectly coiffed from the night, glinted under the pale moonlight. She smiled, a soft, contented curve of her lips that made your chest ache in that sweet, complicated way only first love could. "Best night ever," she whispered, squeezing your hand.

"Definitely," you agreed, a genuine smile spreading across your face. The suburban street was quiet, the houses dark, most of your classmates undoubtedly still at the official after-party or already tucked into bed, dreaming of college applications and summer jobs. This walk home, just the two of you, felt more intimate, more real than anything that had happened at the prom.

A sudden, guttural whisper slithered from the inky blackness between two houses, just ahead. It was too low to make out words, but the sound itself was a cold tendril of fear coiling in your stomach. Chloe stiffened, her grip on your hand tightening. "Did you hear that?" she murmured, her voice barely audible.

Before you could answer, a chilling glint caught the sparse light of a distant streetlamp. A long, serrated blade, held in a gloved hand that emerged from the shadows. Your breath hitched. Your blood ran cold. Ghostface. He was back. And he was crashing the after-party.

A text message notification vibrated in your pocket, a jarringly mundane sound in the face of such terror. You knew, instinctively, that it could be a clue. Or a death sentence.
